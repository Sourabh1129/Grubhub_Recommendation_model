## 🌟 Tech Stack
- **Python:** Data extraction and EDA
- **Power Query:** Minor data adjustments
- **Power Bi:** Dashboard creation and data presentation
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Used Jupyter as IDE
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Developing a recommendation algorithm that considers multiple factors while ensuring scalability and real-time performance was challenging.
- **User Engagement**: Encouraging users to engage with the recommendation system and provide feedback for continuous improvement.

<br>

## 💡 Insights Derived

- **Personalized Recommendations**: The recommendation model provides personalized restaurant suggestions based on user preferences, determines the best location for opening a restaurant.
